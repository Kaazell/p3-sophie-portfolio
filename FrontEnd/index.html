          Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent
          on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light
          touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. I meant 'physically'.
          Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean
          the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only
          person who ever loved me. Ah, computer dating.
          <strong>
            It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside
            your head.</strong

          Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well,
          that's love for you.

          Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Have you ever tried
          just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting
          them? Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. I am the man
          with no name, Zapp Brannigan!

            Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery
            can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…

          I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As
          though!

        <p>
          Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even
          greater society above you! Is that a cooking show? I've been there. My
          folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am
          I, the pope?
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only

          <li>No, just a regular mistake.</li>
          <li>
            Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Soon enough. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can
          any of us trust you? Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance
          money! Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!
        </p>
        <p>
          How much did you make me? Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking.
          That's so cute. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser
          title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with
          double prize money.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash
          pickup until January 3rd. They're like sex, except I'm having them!
          Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! I wish! It's a
          nickel.
        </p>
        <p>
          This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety.
          You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes
          me feel angry! And I'm his friend Jesus. There's no part of that
          sentence I didn't like!
        </p>
        <p>
          I love you, buddy! Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with
          sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?
          One hundred dollars. I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I
          want!
        </p>
        <p>
          Negative, bossy meat creature! I wish! It's a nickel. Or a guy who
          burns down a bar for the insurance money! Wow, you got that off the
          Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download
          pornography.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think
          it would be something you'd have to freebase. It's a T. It goes "tuh".
          Bender, we're trying our best. What are their names? Why would I want
          to know that?
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm
          infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Hello,
          little man. I will destroy you! Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They
          work here in the Slurm factory.
        </p>
        <p>
          All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a
          suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! Really?! Bender,
          I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. So, how 'bout them
          Knicks?
        </p>
        <p>
          That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? We're also Santa
          Claus! Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm
          infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. So,
          how 'bout them Knicks?
        </p>
        <p>
          Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Ah, yes! John
          Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he
          pledged not to go on a killing spree. Anyone who laughs is a
          communist!
